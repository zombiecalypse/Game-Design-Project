#The Lost Day#
It was a long time ago. I don’t know how long. I don’t how many years ago, how many months, days or hours. Nobody does.
Conflicts arose, the great nations of our world declared war to each other. The war became cruel and eventually a civil war. Shortly after it was dog eat dog: rich against poor, mechanic against human, power against weakness and magic against purity.
One thing led to the other, the war collapsed, the world collapsed and everything became chaos. The sun disappeared but some light remained, turning places in eternal nights and others to never-ending days. Hot and cold jumped randomly and huge storms of water, ice, sand or simply air chased over the land.
The war was suddenly over, in order to survive people held together. When they realized that the surface was going to be uninhabitable they escaped. Some when underground, some underwater and others again went upward. Very soon everybody was gone, one way or another.

Even though it looks like we lost everything it may not be over yet. We buried ourselves but we have not buried our hate for each other.
